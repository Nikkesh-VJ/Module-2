### AIM
To write a python program to print the triangular star pattern.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Read the integer n from the user using input(). This will determine the number of rows in the pattern.

Step 3:	 Initialize a variable i = 0. This will be used to control the number of spaces before the stars.

Step 4:	 Loop through rows from 0 to n-1 (this will iterate n times to print the required rows).

Step 5:	  For each row, calculate the number of spaces before the stars. 

Step 6:	 The formula for the number of spaces is ((n - rows - 1) * 2) + i. 

Step 7:	 Print the spaces (" ") using the print(" ", end="") statement. 

Step 8:	 Increment i by 1 after each row.

Step 9:	 For each row, print the stars. The number of stars for each row is equal to rows + 1. Print the stars with print("*", end=" ") to separate them with two spaces.

Step 10:	 After printing each row's stars, print a newline to move to the next row using print("").

Step 11:	 Terminate the program.


### PROGRAM
```
n=int(input())
i=0
for rows in range(0,n):
    for cols in range(((n-rows-1)*2)+i):
        print(" ",end="")
    i+=1
    for star in range(rows+1):
        print("*",end="  ")
    print("")
```

### RESULT
Thus the python program to print the triangular start pattern has been implemented and executed successfully.
