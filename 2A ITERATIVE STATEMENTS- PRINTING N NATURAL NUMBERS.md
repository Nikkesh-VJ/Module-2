### AIM
To create a python program for printing n natural numbers.
### ALGORITHM

Step 1:	 Begin the program.

Step 2:	 Use input() to read the value of n (the upper limit) from the user.

Step 3:	 Convert the input to an integer.

Step 4:	 Display the message "Natural Numbers are :".

Step 5:	 Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).

Step 6:	 In each iteration, print the current value of i.

Step 7:	 Terminate the program.


### PROGRAM
```
n=int(input())
print("Natural Numbers are :")
for i in range(1,n+1,1):
    print(i)
```
